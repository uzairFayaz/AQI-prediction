## Introduction

Air quality is a critical factor affecting public health. The AQI provides a standardized way to report air quality and its potential health impacts. This project uses a neural network model to predict AQI values based on chemical pollutant quantities.

## Dataset

The dataset contains the following attributes:

- **AQI Value**: The target variable representing the Air Quality Index.
- **CO AQI Value**: AQI value based on Carbon Monoxide levels.
- **Ozone AQI Value**: AQI value based on Ozone levels.
- **NO2 AQI Value**: AQI value based on Nitrogen Dioxide levels.
- **PM2.5 AQI Value**: AQI value based on Particulate Matter 2.5 levels.
- **Latitude (lat)**: Geographical coordinate.
- **Longitude (LNG)**: Geographical coordinate.

The dataset is numeric and has no missing values, requiring minimal preprocessing.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
Usage
Clone the Repository:


git clone <repository-url>
cd air-quality-index-prediction
Prepare the Dataset:

Place your dataset (AQI and Lat Long of Countries.csv) in the project directory.

Run the Script:

Execute the Python script to train the model and make predictions:


python aqi_prediction.py
Visualize Predictions:

The script will output a plot of future AQI predictions using Matplotlib.

Model
The project uses a neural network model built with TensorFlow's Keras API. The model architecture includes:

Input layer with 6 features.
Two hidden layers with 64 and 32 neurons, respectively, using ReLU activation.
Output layer with 1 neuron for regression.
The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and mean squared error loss function.

Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using the mean squared error on a test dataset. Additionally, predictions are visualized using Matplotlib to provide insights into future AQI values.

Future Work
Hyperparameter Tuning: Explore different model architectures and hyperparameters to improve prediction accuracy.
Feature Engineering: Investigate additional features that may influence AQI, such as weather data.
Deployment: Deploy the model as a web service for real-time AQI predictions.
